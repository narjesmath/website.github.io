<p>My name is Narjes and I'm originally from Tunisia in North Africa. I'm a first year MESM student at the BREN school of Environmental Science & Management and I'm interested in water and coastal marine resource management and conservation. With a passion for problem solving and data analysis, I wish to investigate climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries. My hope is to help identify management solutions to climate change issues especially with regard to food security, sustainability of marine ecosystems and water scarcity.</p>
